## Before-semester Survey

**SUBMIT THIS ON DISCORD**

Send the instructor Peng Du a private message in **Discord**, with the answers to the following survey questions:

  1. Your full name.
  2. Your technical background. For example, What programming language do you know? Have you used C++ before? If yes, on what kind of projects? What's the biggest challenge in those projects?
  3. How much do you know about data structures such as array, list, tree, graph?
  4. How much do you konw about algorithms such as sorting, searching and recursion?
  5. What do you like about programming?
  6. What do you struggle the most when learning about programming?
  7. Feeling of the class so far and suggestions (wait till after the first week). Too fast? Too slow? Lecture too long? My accent hard to understand? 
  8. What's your goal for this 342? Make your answer as specific as possible. Pass the test? Learn to debug? Learn C++?
  9. What do you think would be some of the largest challenges for you to achieve the goal? And what's your plan to tackle them?
  10. What's your system of study? One common thing from those who succeed and those who fail is both of them have actually the same goal: to succeed. The difference result usually lies in their system of study. For example, how do you schedule time? What do you do after each class to study? How do you take notes? How would you get help if there's difficulty?
  
And, lastly, **optionally**, please send a pic of you in Discord together with this survey in Discord. I'm bad with remembering names. A photo would help me connect Discord account and real person much easily for me. Again, this is optional.
